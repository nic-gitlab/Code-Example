# Code-Example
A project assignment from my coding bootcamp. JavaScript/Express/React

These are components I made for a weekly project in a coding bootcamp. 
The code I'd like to highlight is the FAQList component.
The assignment's objective was to fetch and display data using dynamic routes in Express, with a React front  end. 
It also included a form to add new data to be displayed in the browser using state in React.
