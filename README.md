# Code-Example
A project assignment from my coding bootcamp. JavaScript/Express/React

These files are components I made for a weekly project in a coding bootcamp. 
The assignment's objective was to fetch and display data using dynamic routes in Express, with a React front  end. 
It also included a form to add new data to be displayed in the browser using state in React.
The code I'd like to highlight is the FAQList component. 
For an example of using logic -- On line 53 there's a function called toggleQuestionSelect, that opened/closed a drop down display when the user clicked a button.
